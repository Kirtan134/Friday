```

### Core Files

- **`agent.py`**: Main entry point that sets up the LiveKit agent, registers tools, and handles the conversation flow
- **`tools.py`**: Contains all function tools for device control, file operations, system management, and memory
- **`prompts.py`**: Defines Friday's personality, instructions, and response patterns
- **`friday_memory.json`**: Automatically created file that stores conversations, preferences, and tasks

## Configuration

### Customizing Friday's Personality

Edit `prompts.py` to modify:

- Response style and tone
- Available capabilities descriptions
- Example interactions
- Behavioral guidelines

### Adding New Tools

To add new capabilities:

1. Define a new function in `tools.py` with the `@function_tool()` decorator
2. Add the function to the tools list in `agent.py`
3. Update the documentation in `prompts.py`

### Memory Configuration

Memory settings can be modified in `tools.py`:

- Conversation history limit (default: 50 entries)
- Memory file location
- Data retention policies


## Security Considerations

### API Keys

- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Limit API key permissions where possible

### System Access

- Friday has extensive system access - use responsibly
- Review tool permissions before deployment
- Consider running in restricted environment for testing
- Monitor automated actions for unexpected behavior

### Data Privacy

- Memory data is stored locally in JSON format
- No conversation data is sent to external services except LiveKit
- Email credentials are only used for sending emails
- Consider encrypting memory file for sensitive data

##  Advanced Usage

### Custom Integrations

Extend Friday with additional services:

```python
@function_tool()
async def custom_integration(context: RunContext, parameter: str) -> str:
    """Your custom tool description"""
    # Implementation here
    return "Success message"
```

### Automation Scripts

Create complex workflows:

```python
# Example: Morning routine automation
async def morning_routine():
    await open_application(None, "outlook")
    await control_volume(None, "set", 40)
    await capture_screen(None, "morning_desktop.png")
    await send_email(None, "boss@company.com", "Daily Check-in", "Good morning! Ready for the day.")
```
